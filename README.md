## Application
Executes Grover's search algorithm using universal blind quantum computation based on the works of [Broadbent et al][1] and of [Gustiani and DiVincenzo][2].

## Current state:
Runs a two qubit search on a fixed graph state.

## Future plans:
Implement measurements to examine the effects of:
* distance between server and client
* memory lifetimes
* noise on the fidelity of the output qubits  

Implement scalable version of the application.
